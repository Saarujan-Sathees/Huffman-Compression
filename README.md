# Huffman-Compression
A binary implementation of the Huffman Tree Encoding algorithm, as a data stream.

- Allows data from Strings and files to be encoded with EncodeStream, which writes the Huffman-encoded version of the
  given data to the given output file
- Allows encoded files to be decoded with DecodeStream, which can be used in a similar fashion as ifstream from C++
