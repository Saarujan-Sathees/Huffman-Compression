I believe that I was asked to read the chapter, Art Appreciation, to grasp the benefits of teamwork, to 
combat the lack of teamwork in educational and work environments, and learn the impacts of teamwork on 
society and yourself.

First of all, I learned how useful teamwork skills can affect your workplace. In this chapter, the central 
figure of the book acknowledges the fact that he is better, and more accurate at diagnosing patients and 
handling complexities when he is working with a team, where "each of [them] sees the same patient but 
notices different things" (Goldman 47). The process of challenging several viewpoints and thoughts in a 
group, is called team cognition. To add, Dr. Pat Crosskerry, a retired ER physician, believes that 
cognition & thinking can easily be compromised by human factors like distractions and tiredness, which 
leads to intuitive guesses. Through the use of team cognition, however, these educated guesses can be 
challenged with other observations, leading to a diagnosis which the entire team collaboratively decided upon.

In addition, there is a giant lack of teamwork in educational and workplace environments. Many universities 
and even schools in general often encourage students to solely use textbooks and resources to boost their 
learning. However, the lack of collaborative skills seeps into various fields of work, especially in the 
medical field. Dr. Mark L. Graber also believes that while teamwork allows people of varying experiences 
and backgrounds to collaboratively decide on an accurate diagnosis, there is a lack of teamwork as standard 
practice not only in the medical field, but also in medical programs at universities. This prevents new 
graduates from being aware of the benefits of teamwork in their field. In the medical field, it is crucial 
to recognize that textbooks do not diagnose similar health issues; they are mainly designed to deal with a 
specific complication, which is why doctors should learn how to identify problems based on symptoms, not 
just textbooks.

Finally, the skills demonstrated in this chapter can not only positively impact your career, but also your 
personal life and the lives of those around you. In a situation involving Dr. Joel Katz, Katz and their 
team employed the visual thinking strategies to properly identify the cause of life-threatening implications 
for a patient. If not for these strategies, the patient would have been misdiagnosed with a stroke, which 
would have eventually led to his death by neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare reaction to antipsychotics 
like the olanzapine the patient was prescribed for sleeping issues. A negative impact from the lack of 
teamwork, was also experienced by Alexa Miller, in an indirect manner. Her sister was misdiagnosed with 
schizophrenia and OCD, and was heavily sedated with unnecessary psychotics to the point of being unable to 
talk. This resulted in harsh treatment from her family and her doctors, which lasted until her twenties, 
where she was properly diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. These incidents are demonstrations of the positive 
impacts of teamwork, as well as how humility can be developed by putting aside your ego in order to listen 
to the observations of others.
